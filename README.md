In this personal project, I will explore Real Estate data from houses in Madrid in order to train a model and predict

I will also create a simple web interface in order to allow the user to predict house prices in an interactive way.

The data can be obtained from
[Madrid real estate market](https://www.kaggle.com/mirbektoktogaraev/madrid-real-estate-market)
